# Metro-Matcher

A web game made for my Advanced Higher CompSci Project that revolves around drawing a metro's map, using only the info of the lines and stops. It loads data from json and saves leaderboard data to json. It uses the JS canvas as well, and uses the *Structural Similarity Index* to compare the user's submitted image with a correct solution image.

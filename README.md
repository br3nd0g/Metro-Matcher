# Metro-Matcher

A web game made for my Advanced Higher CompSci Project that revolves around drawing a metro's map, using only the info of the lines and stops. It loads data from json and saves leaderboard data to json. It uses the JS canvas as well, and uses the *Structural Similarity Index* to compare the user's submitted image with a correct solution image.

Please note that only the Singapore metro has its data filled in, I will *at some point* get round to adding the data for the other metros.

If the game page of the site loads emppty, please refresh. This is an issue with the Javascript running operations using a variable before the variable exists, this will be fixed.

You can try it [here](http://brendog.pythonanywhere.com/).
